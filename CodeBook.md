This file describes the variables in the data file `result.txt`, created by the script in `run_analysis.R`.

The variables were selected from the full set from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"


contains information about any variable names in your final tidy data set, a brief definition or purpose of each variable, any units of measurement, and transformations to the raw data resulting in the tidy data.
